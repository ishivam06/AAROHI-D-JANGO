                    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;All the movie buffs were in for a treat as Aarohi called for its Cinematic Edition to go in 'Action' with the dawn of 18th October 2019. This edition of Aarohi saw a mind-boggling bike show by KTM, a high spirited talk show by Kriti Vij, continuing with the food fest, 'Foodiestaan' a spread of food stalls for everyone to savour and everything that spoke of movies! That year, the 'Cultural Nite' was organised for the first time away from campus with Hrishikesh Ranade casting a melodious spell on everyone in the audience. While the stand up night by Comicstaan winner, Akash Gupta left everyone just 'ummm', the events saw the participants put their best foot forward keeping the spirit of competition high! And then the last evening of Aarohi'19 had everyone in the most joyful of moods as we came together to enjoy life singing along with the famous music-composer duo, Sachet Parampara creating musical magic in the air! That night, all the hearts sang in one tone, one rhythm, one symphony…. 'A Universal Symphony'!

                    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the last weekend of October 2018, all of us entered a new dimension of 'Fictional Reality' as Aarohi witnessed one of the grandest editions ever. The entire campus, from the gates till the auditorium was all about good vibes, happy times and an amazing experience. This edition of Aarohi was also a treat for all the foodies, with the first food fest, 'Foodiestaan' being organised and it couldn't have been better! While we did host Yayha Bootwala and Amandeep Singh on a poetic evening, the 'Cultural Nite' left everyone laughing till they couldn't take more with 'Comedy aani Barach Kahi'. The participants across all events took it as a challenge to outshine everything Aarohi had witnessed till then and the campus decor rejoiced along with the 'Wishing Tree' granting everyone their wish of a fantastic weekend. The stand-up night by Kanan Gill and the evening when Naalayak, the band performed are each in themselves stories to tell with all this who were a part of those evenings having their own editions of the same. The night of 28th October 2018 then pulled us out of the Fictional Reality as a Cinematic experience awaited our presence!

                    During the month of October 2017, Aarohi did celebrate all facets of life as we celebrated 30 glorious years of Aarohi, a legacy that's too precious for all of us. We celebrated the joy of friends, calm of classical concerts, spirit of competition, vibe of rock shows, duty towards society and love for the fest along with our Aarohi Family. While the blood donation camp organised provided a sense of responsibility, the Cultural Nite with Milind Ingale and Kishor Kadam was a peaceful musical escapade along with the undercurrent of the entire campus speaking everything festive all the time. The performers across all the events surpassed all previous standards and it was a delight to have it written down in the history of Aarohi. As Zakir Khan took the stage, each of the hearts in the audience 'pighal gaye' with his stories making people laugh but touching their souls at the same time. And well, the night when 'The Local Train' performed, everyone was singing along in unison which made the entire auditorium seem to come alive! As the night neared it's end all of us felt like staying in that moment and living in that 'Fictional Reality' FOREVER!!

                    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Now that we have been walking down the memory lane, our next stop is that edition of Aarohi which took everyone along that year! With the amazing line-up of events, this edition of Aarohi was a delight to the eyes and solace to the heard for everyone who was a part of it. From breathtaking dance moves in Á la Dansè to performances by bands during Purple Haze that made the atmosphere electrifying, those 3 days of February 2017 saw all of it. Dark comedy by Daniel Fernandes made everyone look at stand-up comedy in a new 'light'. Doing justice to the 'Moh Moh ke Dhaage' as Papon entranced everyone with his soulful voice on the night that marked the end of Aarohi'17, we did feel a connection with Aarohi and the people associated like we had never before! As the curtains for this edition of Aarohi fell, another celebration of life, friends and  Aarohi started taking shape which was written down in the history of Aarohi sooner than the usual with the next edition being organised in the month of October of the same year unlike all the previous ones!

                    Being a part of Aarohi gives the phrase, 'Hakuna Matata' a whole new dimension with people around being the reason for it but Aarohi'16 made it official for the world to know! The vibe of the college from the very beginning spoke of celebrating Life. The cycle rally organised to create awareness about traffic and speed control saw a massive turnout. Catching up with the 'Katyaar Kaljat Ghusli', that year the 'Cultural Nite' saw a spellbound audience with the voice of Mahesh Kale casting the spell! That was just the beginning of an incredible line-up we had to offer along with the wide range of events like Swarmanzar, Cynosure amongst others. While dance workshops for Cha-cha-cha nad Waltz made people wear their dance shoes, 3-on-3 had all the sports enthusiasts excited! With Kenny Sebastian bringing the house down with his almost everyday life comedy, the soulful songs by Euphoria with 'Maeri' being the highlight, was everything one could ask for to make those days the beautiful memories as we look back today. As the night of 28th February 2016 neared its end, all the hearts in the auditorium of our college were beating in unison celebrating the spirit of Aarohi and were already going down the memory lane!

                    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;First ever Coke Studio, first ever Sunburn.... Do these firsts ring in some memory? Maybe the February of 2015 is what you're recollecting!! The days when Aarohi'15 was supposed to be associated with horror according to the theme but like every time, it ended up making a place for itself in the hearts of those who experienced it for the first time while making the other hearts even more fonder. From the extending a helping hand to 'Amhi Amchya Arogyadaathi', a group working towards betterment of elderly and women in need to literally shaking the walls as the crowds swayed to the tunes of Raghu Dixit, this edition of Aarohi saw life in all it's grandeur. This year of Aarohi saw 2 proshows being organised for the first time and both of them getting sold out within no time. The spirit of Aarohi was celebrated throughout events like Cynosure, Pentathon, Dramatics amongst others, through social initiatives and through getting everyone along to become one family which celebrated life before the legacy passed onto the next batch who, it seemed did not have any worries, thanks to the batch of Aarohi'15 who set the bar so high!

                    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For all the fantasy movies and series fans, from Game of Thrones to Lord of the Rings, the February of 2014 brought along exactly everything associated with their favourites when Aarohi'14 opened it's doors for everyone to be a part of that spendour. Taking the 25 years old legacy ahead, we had an amazing 'Cultural Nite' which was filled by the sweet and melodious voice of Devaki Pandit making everyone experience what music stands for. Like always , we had a great participation in all the events, be it 'Swarmanzar' or 'À la Dansé' but what made us the happiest was that we organised 'Cynosure' again after a hiatus and that event was welcomed by all with open arms. The curtains fell for Aarohi'14 with one of the longest performances by a band that is an emotion for all of till date, 'Agnee'. That night as the band brought the show to an end, all the eyes had tears just thinking about how much Aarohi meant to us and the fact that we did manage to have the  Aarohi of our dreams. 
                    <br>
                    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That year, we, the Aarohi Family, stood for each each other like families do, literally through storms as the roads leading to our little world were blocked by trees due to a rainstorm. We had some serious issues from blocked roads to running water, and then others that we were more than happy to have like an OVERWHELMING PARTICIPATION going much beyond anything seen till then. With the hope of keeping this legacy alive, we did pass on the baton to the next batch knowing for sure that the legacy and those moments shall stay FOREVER!!
